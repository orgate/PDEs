Files:

1) pde_solver.py - Solution of (heat eqution) PDE as time progresses - Magnitude of u or temperature
2) pde_solver1.py - Solution of (heat equation) PDE when iterated in the forward direction and in the reverse direction
3) pde_gen.py - This code solves any 2nd order PDE of the form:	(A*uxx) + (B*uxy) + (C*uyy) + (D*ux) + (E*uy) + (F*u) = G,
				where uxx means 2nd partial derivative of u along x-axis and similarly other notations 
				and A,B,C,D,E,F and G are real numbers
4) pde_monte.py - This code gives an approximate Monte-Carlo solution to the heat equation with the same initial and boundary conditions

Also attached are the figures of graphs associted with each of the codes.

Usage: (Example given only for the code "pde_solver.py")

In Linux terminal, just type (in the direcotry containing the file):
python pde_solver.py

Similarly for the other 3 codes too.
